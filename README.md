Hi, I'm Stefan

I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo

Interested in safety-critical embedded software, mcu architecture, operating systems, and rtl design

When not working on code, I'm trying my best to learn the Japanese language (下手です)

feel free to reach me at svtuczyn [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca
